## Tackling Overfitting Problems
### Case 1: Feature Selection Using Mutual Information 
Case description: 
* low correlation coefficient between target and domain knowledge- based critical factors
* high corrrelation coefficient between target and features but the scatter plots show multiple clusters.
Mutual information serves as a valuable metric for quantifying the dependency between variables, making it particularly useful for selecting relevant features and reduces dimensionality in datasets.
